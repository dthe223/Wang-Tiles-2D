# Wang-Tiles-2D

I use recursive backtracking algortithm to implement wang tiles on a area with dimensions that are defined by the user during run time. The user can also choose if they want the tiles to be displayed in a normal grid starting at the top right corner, going row by row and finishing at the bottom right corner; or they can choose to display the tiles in a spiral that starts in the center of the grid.

# Zelle Graphics Library
I use the Zelle graphics library to draw the wang tiles or place the images onto the screen in the correct order.  I plan on changing to a better library whenever I have free time with school. But this library is very easy to learn if you're not too experienced. 
Just go to mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/ and save the "graphics.py" file to:

  Windows:  C:\Python35\Lib\site-packages     (or wherever your python installation directory is)
  Linux:
